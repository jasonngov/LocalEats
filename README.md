# Getting Started 
I created this project to familiarize myself with Jupyter Notebook. To run this build locally, you must clone this repository, install Jupyter Notebook, and register your own local FourSquare development app.

Here are some docs to help install Jupyter Notebook locally:\
https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Docs for FourSquare Developer Setup:\

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `jupyter notebook`
This launches a new browser window showing the Notebook Dashboard. Navigate to the following file, LocalEats.ipynb and run the script.


## Future Work, Ideas
- Allow users to enter zip code
- Convert map from finding local restauraunts to displaying local COVID-19 vaccinations sites
  - Will need to scrape web for location sites and addresses
